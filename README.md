# RSVP Movies Global Project Analysis

## Project Overview
RSVP Movies, a prominent Indian film production company known for producing several blockbuster movies, is planning to expand its audience by releasing a movie targeted at the global market in 2022. To ensure the success of this ambitious project, they are seeking data-driven insights to guide their decisions throughout the production and release process. 

As a data analyst and SQL expert, your role is to analyze the data from movies released over the past three years and provide actionable recommendations that RSVP Movies can use to optimize their strategy for the upcoming global release.

## Business Context
RSVP Movies has a rich history of producing films primarily for the Indian audience. However, entering the global market introduces new challenges and opportunities that require a deep understanding of global movie trends. The company aims to leverage data analytics to make informed decisions that align with global audience preferences, maximize box office success, and enhance international brand recognition.

To achieve this, RSVP Movies needs a comprehensive analysis of historical movie data, which includes various performance metrics such as box office revenue, audience demographics, genres, and release strategies. This analysis will help identify key factors that contribute to a movie's success on a global scale.

## Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are to:

1. **Analyze Historical Data**: Use SQL to analyze data from movies released over the past three years to uncover trends and patterns.
2. **Identify Key Success Factors**: Determine the factors that contribute most to a movie's success in the global market, such as genre popularity, release timing, and audience demographics.
3. **Provide Actionable Insights**: Offer data-driven recommendations to RSVP Movies on how to plan their global release, including marketing strategies, ideal release windows, and content focus.
4. **Support Strategic Decision-Making**: Equip RSVP Movies with the insights needed to make informed decisions at every stage of the project, from pre-production to post-release.

## Project Segments
To structure the analysis, the project has been divided into four key segments:

1. **Segment 1**: Analyze audience demographics and preferences to identify target markets and potential audience segments for the global release.
2. **Segment 2**: Evaluate the performance of different movie genres to determine which genres have the highest potential for success in the global market.
3. **Segment 3**: Assess the impact of release timing on box office performance to recommend the best release windows for the global market.
4. **Segment 4**: Synthesize insights from previous segments to provide a comprehensive set of recommendations for RSVP Movies' global project.

Each segment involves analyzing specific combinations of tables using SQL queries, leading to significant insights that will guide RSVP Movies in planning their global release.

## Business Impact
By conducting this analysis, RSVP Movies will gain a deeper understanding of global movie trends and the factors that drive international success. The recommendations provided will enable the company to:

- Optimize their content strategy for global appeal.
